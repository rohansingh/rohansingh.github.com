Hey all,

Just thinking about possibilities for this next weekend. Feel free to throw in your thoughts, or
just be advised of possibilties. Probably the most important thing to figure out is if anyone wants
to do Haul Ash on Sunday or not (more info below).

First off, there's that whole solar eclipse thing. It will be around 6 PM on Sunday and will last
for about 90 minutes. The weather for Sunday is forecasted to be somewhat cloudy and maybe rainy,
both here and elsewhere like Leavenworth. But I guess we'll see what we can see.

On Sunday, I guess Haul Ash is still a possibility, depending on how interested people are. This
year is the same route as last year with the halfway point at LTD. It's $30 this year for
pre-registration, or $40 at the door, though apparently you get a backpack this year
(see [http://rrs.co/JLwMOg](http://rrs.co/JLwMOg) for more info). Personally I'm somewhat
indifferent on this one.

Another thing happening next weekend is the U-District Street Fair, which includes the Big Time
patio and all that.

Here are some other highlights for Saturday:

* [German Bier "Extravaganza" at Shultzy's](http://rrs.co/LEKDoC). Well, at least it's beer. Might be a good place to watch
  the Sounders game, which I believe is at 11:30 AM.

* [Jolly Roger Parking Lot Party at Maritime from 1-11 PM](http://rrs.co/LELMMO). It's like an outdoor party with beer and
  food, and a carribean band is playing at 2 PM. Hmm.

* [Maui Brewing at Noble Fir (Ballard) from 4-8 PM](http://rrs.co/LEGW26). This is actually kind of exciting since they'll
  be boldy pouring Maui beers that have never been poured before.

As for Sunday, like I said, Haul Ash is still a possibility. But if we don't do that, Fremont
Brewing has decided to just be fucking awesome and have a [free BBQ from 12-3 PM](http://rrs.co/JLwtmC).

Also on Sunday, pretty much all day, [Old Town in Ballard is having sour and oak-aged Cascade brews on tap](http://rrs.co/LEMVUB).

Hmm, now that I look at this list, it's pretty much all about beer. Oh well.
