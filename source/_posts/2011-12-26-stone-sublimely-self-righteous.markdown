Every winter for the past few years, I've spent at least a weekend in San Diego.
Not only is the tropical sun a great respite from gloomy Seattle, but San Diego
— against all odds and expectations — is a brilliant beer town, and home to the
iconic [Stone Brewing Co](http://www.stonebrew.com).

To get myself into the right mindset for my upcoming trip, tonight I am
enjoying Stone's _Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale_. As frequent drinkers of Stone
are surely aware, that brewery is full of [downright bastards](http://www.stonebrew.com/arrogantbastard).

Which is why I just had to share this brilliant excerpt from the label on the
back of this dastardly, [self-rightous bottle](http://www.stonebrew.com/sublimely/):

> Yes, we damn well know our stuff here at Stone, and it would be irresponsible
> of us to not acknowledge how remarkable this heavenly creation of ours is. Thus
> the name we are compelled to give it — Stone Sublimely Self-Rightous Ale –
> serves as a reminder of just how good we are, in both liquid and verbal form.

And also:

> When you're good, you're good. And when you do something great, the least you
> can do is acknowledge it. Others benefit from knowing.

For the record, this self-righteous ale lives up to its label and leaves a smile
on your face — or, at least, on mine.
