Here's some of my favorite things that I've read lately:

* [The days are long but the decades are short](http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short).
  A great writeup from Sam Altman with a good smattering of advice on a whole bunch of topics.

* [Ready for Rain: Why Seattleites Crave the End of Summer](https://medium.com/@leelefever/ready-for-rain-f14703d4f4a8).
  I actually read this over the winter, but it's a beautiful article that really made me miss the PNW.

* [How to Downsize a Transport Network](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/12/the-chinese-wheelbarrow.html).
  Never in my life did I think that I'd use the phrase "gripping, exciting article about wheelbarrows",
  but that's exactly what this is.

* ["Why is software so expensive?"](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD648.html).
  Something that I thought I already knew the answer to, but which I'd never thought about like this.

Discussion welcome.
