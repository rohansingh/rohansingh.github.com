If you haven't heard about [ACTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement),
it's a damaging piece of legislation very similar to [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act)
â€” the difference being that ACTA is international in scope and much closer to
becoming reality than SOPA ever was. [Here is a video explaining ACTA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0)
which I found to be quite educational.

Anyway, Stockholm decided to take to the streets to [protest ACTA today](https://www.facebook.com/events/332489143440319/).
Here are a few photos of the fairly well-attended event that I managed to snap
on my phone:
