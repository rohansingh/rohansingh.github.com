Here's my idea for the day: a variable gas tax based on local density and
transit availability. This could help the state raise revenue and encourage
people to park their cars where possible. But at the same time, it would make
sure those who absolutely need to drive aren't put in an impossible position.
 
For an example, consider Seattle. Most of the city has medium-to-high density
and transit is widely available. Residents can get to work and school using the
bus, light rail, or bicycles. Walkable neighborhoods mean that you can stroll
to your destination as well. If we can reduce the number of cars on the street
while encouraging healthier, more sustainable lifestyles and helping the city
build better neighborhoods, it makes sense for gas to cost as much as $5
per gallon.

A counterexample would be a town like Ellensburg, WA. Though it is
technically a college town, density is low and mass transit is virtually
nonexistent. This is a place you really couldn't survive without a car.
This is a place where you wouldn't raise gas taxes, but also a place that
would benefit from the increased gas tax revenues elsewhere.

An additional feature would be to only apply this variable gas tax to
individual consumers at that point of sale. It would not apply to small
businesses or freight, so the price of food or other goods would not be
affected.

Just an idea I thought up on the ride home so there could be some major
hole I'm missing. But I think it's important to consider alternative tax
structures that could help everyone.

Thoughts?
