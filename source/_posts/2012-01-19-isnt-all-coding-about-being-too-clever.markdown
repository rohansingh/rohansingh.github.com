Every now and then I have a discussion or lecture with my roommate Chris, on some aspect of software
engineer, architecture, process management, or programming in general. His specialization is
psychology, so while this exercise can be cathartic, it's largely pointless. I've decided that it
might be more effective to write these things down and post them.

Today, prompted by a discussion on what I should name some new object, Chris asked:

> Isn't all coding about being too clever?

I think that is a conception that many laypeople and beginning programmers have — that we should try
to be clever. Seasoned engineers will know that being clever can be one of the worst sins.

Here was my response, paraphrased:

That said, sometimes you do come across clever code that meets all of those requirements. These are
small masterpieces and works of art and should be regarded as such.
