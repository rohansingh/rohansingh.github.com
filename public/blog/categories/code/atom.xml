    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before I begin, here are a few great, relevant xkcd's:
<a href="http://xkcd.com/719/">#719</a>
<a href="http://xkcd.com/430/">#430</a>
<a href="http://xkcd.com/203/">#203</a></p>

<p>Anyhow, say what you will about Scott Rosenberg's book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400082463?tag=rohanradiocom-20">Dreaming in Code</a></em>
— but the fact is, it makes Googling for experiences of <em>actually dreaming in code</em>
<a href="http://google.com/search?q=dreaming+in+code">fairly impossible</a>.</p>

<p>Personally though, I find dreaming in code to be very real.
My dreams have always quite vividly blended reality and the imaginary, often
leaving me confused as to which is which, and leaving me with a somewhat tenuous
connection to the former. Code dreams are no different, and I've found that mine
fit into three major types:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Text Editor</strong>. This is your fairly standard code dream. In my case,
white background, plain text and some code appearing or being written.
Sometimes, it might make sense and actually relate to a project I've been
working on or code I've being writing, but quite often this code doesn't make
any sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>Often, there is no background or text, but just the lines and constructs of
code floating in a place where there is no physical reality. I wonder if
mathematicians have dreams similar to these, but with mathematical constructs?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Inspiration</strong>. These dreams are comparatively rare, and don't actually
seem to involve any coding whatsoever. However, they very specifically relate
to something I am working on, and when I wake up I know how to structure some
code that I have been struggling with.</p>

<p>This seems to be a pretty straightforward case of the brain working on a
waking-world concern while asleep. Too bad the hours aren't billable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Blends With Reality</strong>. This is the strangest type of dream and the
most difficult to relate, but in many ways my favorite. In these dreams,
physical reality seems to blend and mix with the reality of code. While there
is a normal dream of the physical world underlying everything here, in these
dreams I interact with that world with code instead of in the normal physical
manner.</p>

<p>For example, I might find myself writing a script to light a campfire.
Or instead of traveling from place to place by walking or in a car, I might
just fiddle with the parameters that define my location. People may speak in code
or in concepts rather than words.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Overall, I find #3 to be the most common type of code dream I have, as well as
the most interesting. It lets the world become a playground that is strangely
close to the real world. It is almost as if, in these dreams, magic is real, and
code is magic.</p>

<p>While it's probably not the most important thing in the world, I'm really
curious to hear whether lots of other people out there dream in code, and how
everyone else's code dreams differ from mine.</p>

<p>After all, we spend an amazing amount of time asleep throughout the course of
our lives. Who knows, maybe if talk about dreaming code enough, clients will
agree that those hours asleep should be billable after all, eh?</p>

    <link href="http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2011/03/28/getting-asp-dot-net-to-play-nice-with-opera-and-wget/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-28T15:43:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2011/03/28/getting-asp-dot-net-to-play-nice-with-opera-and-wget</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we noticed an issue with some crawlers and search engines being
unable to crawl <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks.com</a>. Around the same time,
<a href="http://my.opera.com/karlcow/">Karl Dubost</a> from Opera discovered that
<a href="http://my.opera.com/karlcow/blog/2011/03/03/wrong-to-be-right-with-xhtml">visitors using Opera were getting a parse error</a>.
In fact, a number of high-profile ASP.NET sites seem to be impacted by the latter issue.</p>

<p>If you're just looking for the quick fix, skip ahead to the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>To sum up the issue, our server was responding with a <code>Content-Type</code> header of
<code>application/xhtml+xml</code> to both Opera and <code>wget</code>. In Opera, this triggers an XML
parser, which would fail since our content is actually <code>text/html</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, nowhere in our code were explicitly setting the <code>Content-Type</code> header
to anything other than <code>text/html</code>, so the behavior was puzzling. Additionally,
the server was responding with an <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> type even when the
Accept header from the browser specified <code>*/*</code>. This made no sense at all, since
if the browser was willing to accept anything, we should be sending the content
in its default <code>text/html</code>.</p>

<h2>ASP.NET Browser Detection</h2>

<p>As it turns out, ASP.NET has a somewhat questionable
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3yekbd5b.aspx">feature that allows you detect browser types and capabilities</a>,
largely based on the browser's request headers. This is mediated through a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228122.aspx">browser definition file</a>
(*.browser), which is just a bunch of XML that matches up request header
patterns to browser types and know capabilities. This file lives in your
ASP.NET applicaiton's App_Browsers folder.</p>

<p>The known capabilities for the current user agent are all available through the
<code>HttpContext.Request.Browser</code> object.</p>

<p>As I said, all very questionable. The idea of having a giant database of
browsers and what they are like just rubs me wrong and strikes me as
unmaintainable. In fact, we only tried out the whole browser definition file as
part of a proof-of-concept for some mobile pages. The feature never quite worked
correctly, so we abandoned it and thought that was the end of that.</p>

<h2>The insidious preferredRenderingMime</h2>

<p>Of course, that wasn't the end of that. For each browser definition in a browser
definition file, you can define a <code>preferredRenderingMime</code> value for a browser.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;capabilities&gt;
  &lt;capability name="preferredRenderingMime" value="application/xhtml+xml" /&gt;
&lt;/capabilities&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the larger *.browser file compilations floating around the Web have
Opera set to preferring a MIME type of <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. A lot of files
will default to a preferred type of <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> for all browsers that
pass an Accept: <em>/</em> request header.</p>

<p>And even though we use ASP.NET MVC and no longer are using any of the browser
detection stuff at all, the System.Web.UI.Page class has this fun code that runs
when the page is processed:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">HttpCapabilitiesBase</span> <span class="n">browser</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">_request</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Browser</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">_response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ContentType</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">browser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PreferredRenderingMime</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="n">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">&gt;}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Brilliant, right? Since Opera prefers XHTML, this code does you the favor of
automatically setting your response content type to <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. Of
course, since your actual content is still HTML, this causes an XML parse error
and all your Opera visitors are hosed.</p>

<p>This might make sense if you are doing the classic ASP.NET Web Forms thing with
server controls that adapt their rendering based on the browser's preferred
MIME. But even if you are using ASP.NET MVC, your .aspx views are still
essentially pages, and this old code will still run.</p>

<h2>Broken <code>wget</code></h2>

<p>Unfortunately, this <code>SetIntrinsics</code> code has another nasty side effect. If your
application has already sent out response headers or content, it will just throw
an exception since <code>Response.ContentType</code> can't be set after response headers have
already been sent.</p>

<p>In the case of Starbucks.com, this meant that issue wasn't just that Opera
visitors experienced a parse error, but that an exception would be thrown for
any browser for which ASP.NET tried to switch the <code>Response.ContentType</code>. This
would result in absolutely no content being served, resulting in a blank page
for Opera visitors.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a large percentage of crawlers and search engines use <code>wget</code> to
grab pages. <code>wget</code> sends an <code>Accept</code> header of <code>*/*</code>, and runs into the same
no-content issue. A fine mess all around.</p>

<h2>The fix</h2>

<p>The simplest fix, of course, is to get rid of any *.browser files you may be
using in your application. I understand redirecting to a mobile version of your
site for mobile browsers or the like, but basing any major functionality on
guesses about the user's browser is a great path to future pain.</p>

<p>If, however, you want to keep your browser definition files around, consider
removing any uses of the <code>preferrendRenderingMime</code> capability. Here's a regex that
should be able to find those instances for you:</p>

<pre><code>^.+"preferredRenderingMime".+$
</code></pre>

<p>Just do a find &amp; replace on that and you should be good to go. This is what we
ended up doing for <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks.com</a> and
<a href="http://starbucks.co.uk">Starbucks.co.uk</a>, which I'm happy to say now
work perfectly for Opera and <code>wget</code> users alike!</p>

    <link href="http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2011/02/22/posting-json-with-jquery/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-22T22:23:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2011/02/22/posting-json-with-jquery</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I've been a big fan of JSON via HTTP POST to send data to a Web service.
It's awesome for a bunch of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Works equally well for simple and complex data.</strong> Regular HTTP POST works great
for simple data, but gets unwieldy for anything hierarchical. XML works for
complex data, but is too wordy for something simple.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compact and human-readable.</strong> Really, this just comes with the territory when
you're using JSON for anything.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to debug using Fiddler or related tools.</strong> You just have to type in or
modify a JSON string when you want to do some ad-hoc testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to add support for to any server.</strong> In fact, support for receiving JSON
POST is built into the latest versions of
<a href="http://docs.cherrypy.org/dev/refman/lib/jsontools.html">CherryPy</a> and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.jsonvalueproviderfactory.aspx">ASP.NET MVC</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That said, JSON POST still doesn't seem to be all that popular compared to
an old-style URL-encoded HTTP POST. One explanation I've heard proposed for
this is the lack of support in jQuery. By default, jQuery goes with the
old-style POST. You know:</p>

<pre><code>foo=bar&amp;abc=xyz&amp;x=123
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, you can pass in a complex type and jQuery will gladly serialize it
into this format for you, but good luck trying to read that with your human
eyes, or trying to piece it back together on the server in any sane way.</p>

<p>The really sad thing is that jQuery has a great <code>getJSON()</code> function that lets
you receive JSON output and parses it appropriately. But there is no
built-in support for posting raw JSON.</p>

<p>To that end, I threw together this little plugin that I use all over the
place:</p>

    <link href="http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2010/09/13/4-simple-rules-for-catching-net-exceptions/"/>
    <updated>2010-09-13T16:58:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2010/09/13/4-simple-rules-for-catching-net-exceptions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What follows has probably been expounded a thousand times in different places.
In fact, MSDN even has a long article entitled
<a href="http://rrs.co/aMavUs">Best Practices for Handling Exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>That said, I believe the best practices when it comes to catching .NET
exceptions can be boiled down into four basic rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do not catch an exception unless you have something specific you need to do with
that exception in the place you are catching it. Generally, there’s two
scenarios where it’s alright to catch an exception:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you can do something specific to respond to and recover from a specific
exception.</li>
<li>When you have specific logging or, in the UI, want to display a specific error
message due to a specific exception.</li>
</ol>


<p>Every exception and every catch block incurs a major performance overhead. If
you can’t do something that fits into one of these two categories, you generally
should not catch the exception. Note that this means that catching <code>Exception</code>
instead of a specific type of exception is almost never correct.</p></li>
<li><p>When you want to convert an exception to a string for logging, just use
<code>ex.ToString()</code>. Do not try to <code>ToString()</code> or do any complex operations on any of
the exception's other properties in a way that could fail if those properties are
null. For example, <code>ex.SomeProperty.ToString()</code> is almost never correct since
<code>SomeProperty</code> might be null. Even if it seems to not be null when you are
testing, since this is by definition an exceptional case you can’t be sure what
properties of the exception may or may not be filled.</p>

<p>More generally, avoid doing things in a catch block that may cause another
exception to be thrown. Don’t nest try-catch blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Never do anything that would hide an exception from bubbling up unless you have
specific code that can recover from the exception. For example, even if you are
logging an exception in your catch block, rethrow it so any logging code higher
up will be able to process it as well.</p>

<p>The only time you should not rethrow an
exception is when you can recover from it and the code can keep running fine.</p>

<p>That said, if you can recover from an exception and the code can keep running,
see if it would be possible to predict the exception beforehand and avoid it. As
an example, say you are going to try to call <code>ToUpper()</code> on a string. If the
string is null beforehand, you already know that a null reference exception will
be thrown, so don’t call <code>ToUpper()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you rethrow an exception, always just use <code>throw;</code>. Do not use <code>throw ex;</code>.
The latter restarts the call stack and makes debugging much more difficult. The only
time you would do the latter is if you want to hide internals for some reason
like security, which is almost never needed.</p></li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2010/08/16/html5-database-api-support-in-an-android-webview/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-16T22:06:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2010/08/16/html5-database-api-support-in-an-android-webview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>HTML5 has a <a href="http://html5demos.com/database">Database API</a> that lets you
store things locally and retrieve them with SQL queries.</li>
<li>Android lets you embed a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html">WebView</a>
in your application to display web content.</li>
<li>How to combine #1 and #2 is extremely poorly documented.</li>
</ol>


<p>One thing that kills me about the Android documentation is how it's so
hit-or-miss. Some things are so well documented that I have literally been able
to copy code out of the docs into my code and just change it a little. Actually,
my roommate saw me do this at one point and accused me of plagiarism. But that
is the subject of another post entitled "Why You Shouldn't Take Coding Advice
From Psychology Majors".</p>

<p>But really, I think the #1 best thing you can do when releasing a platform or
public API of any sort is include tons of samples, inline with the
documentation. The real winners when it comes to doing this are the
<a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php">PHP documentation</a> and the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312.aspx">MSDN .NET Framework documentation</a>.
Almost every single class and function in the docs for these platforms includes
a sample of how to use the thing.</p>

<p>Maybe it's not a coincidence that PHP and .NET are so popular?</p>

<p>It took me way too long to find out how to enable HTML5 Database API support for
content displayed inside a WebView on an Android. The pieces were scattered all
over the Intertubes, though I finally found the last piece of the puzzle on
<a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/2009/11/05/how-to-implement-html5-storage-on-a-webview-with-android-2-0/">Joe Bowser's blog</a>.

<p>Note that the <code>onExceededDatabaseQuota</code> is mandatory. I am pretty sure the default
quota is zero, so you need to override this method and provide a quota to allow
storage. I'm using <code>estimatedSize * 2</code> as the new quota since my app is browsing
to a known page that only stores a small amount of data. Your scenario may be
different.</p>
