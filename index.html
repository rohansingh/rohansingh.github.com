  <div class="entry-content"><p><small><em>Statements and opinions that follow are entirely my own</em></small></p>

<p>One thing I&#8217;m excited about lately are the brand new music discovery features we&#8217;re working on at
Spotify. If you haven&#8217;t heard, here&#8217;s a sneak peek:</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mcndH5zvm6U?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Discovering new music is brilliant, even if it&#8217;s just new to <em>you</em> and everyone else heard it years
ago. As part of a generation that largely didn&#8217;t experience it, I finally have some understanding
of what people loved about the &#8220;sifting through albums at the record store&#8221; experience of yesteryear.
Personalized music discovery is awesome.</p>

<p>In that vein, I thought I&#8217;d share some of the new music that I&#8217;ve discovered over the past month or
so. These artists and tracks aren&#8217;t specifically <em>new</em>, but they were all new to me. If you just want
the TL;DR, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/rohanrsingh/playlist/31nT82bgnsMpdSRS5PCILh">here is the <em>Discovered: Winter 2013</em> playlist</a>
that I put together. It&#8217;s a shorter list that I&#8217;ve found works excellently for seeding a radio station.</p>

<p>Now let me talk a bit about these artists, from a Portland outfit that did a literal <em>bicycle tour</em>
of the Pacific Coast, to an indie band who used Kickstarter to make their next album possible, to a
socially conscious rapper from Nova Scotia.</p>

<h2>Bronze Radio Return (Hartford, CT)</h2>

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:0hO7tdTpSVN1ADtLbvJiQ5&theme=white&view=coverart"
    width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"
    style="float:left;margin-right:30px;"></iframe>


<p>This indie rock band hails from Connecticut, and performed for Barack Obama in 2010. This album,
<em>Shake! Shake! Shake!</em>, is actually from 2011, but Bronze Radio Return is <a href="http://bronzeradioreturn.com/">still alive and kicking</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a good chance you heard the eponymous  <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4dI4oscajpdtjpg2dP1x28">&#8220;Shake, Shake, Shake&#8221;</a>
when it was featured in a Nissan Leaf commercial. I first heard it as I was
running to the subway through a snowstorm in Stockholm, and it fit perfectly.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of those songs that has a slower start but then suddenly turns into
an entirely different beast. When I arrived at the bar where I met my friends,
the first thing I did was to take off my headphones and foist them upon my
unsuspecting companions, making them listen to &#8220;Shake, Shake, Shake&#8221; before
I even got around to ordering a beer.</p>

<p>Another of my favorite tracks is <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/1d6rwEAWQ4zx2ArgIBTVmc">&#8220;Down There&#8221;</a>, which brings
back all my memories of hanging out by the river during the summer after high school. While I realize
that Bronze Radio Return is probably thinking of a river in New England while I&#8217;m thinking of
a very specific river in the Pacific Northwest, the whole experience is still very Americana.</p>

<p>Overall, the whole album served as an excellent for snowboarding in the northwest over the holidays,
including for the drives to and from the slopes. And if you&#8217;re heading to <a href="http://sxsw.com">SXSW</a>
this year, you&#8217;re in luck. Bronze Radio Return will be playing on March 11.</p>

<h2>Great Lake Swimmers (Toronto, Ontario, Canada)</h2>

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:5RArdv6T3ck7BmZHI7inmz&theme=white&view=coverart"
    width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"
    style="float:right;margin-left:30px;"></iframe>


<p>If there was a band that I could say characterizes what I think of when I think of Canadian indie
folk, this would be it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lake_Swimmers">Great Lake Swimmers</a>
is a folk rock group from Toronto, and you can almost <em>hear</em> the geography of Ontario in their music.
At the core, communicating about their environment is what these guys are about. Tony Dekker, the
lead vocalist, actually contributed a <a href="http://blog.wwf.ca/blog/2013/01/23/tony-dekker-on-the-physical-spiritual-and-philosophical-connection-between-music-and-nature/">short piece on this to the WWF</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say that my favorite Great Lake Swimmers album is <em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5RArdv6T3ck7BmZHI7inmz">Ongiara</a></em>,
their 2008 release. Definitely worth a listen.</p>

<p>As for the latest album, <em>New Wild Everywhere</em>, I haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet but there&#8217;s actually
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0tT8zJriwVQXccHxQLiqGB">a version with track-by-track commentary from the band</a>
available.</p>

<h2>Blind Pilot (Portland, OR)</h2>

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:6eLMGMZE8Kv9lCGCk551Bu&theme=white&view=coverart"
    width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"
    style="float:left;margin-right:30px;"></iframe>


<p>From the other side of the continent, we have <a href="http://blindpilot.com">Blind Pilot</a>. These folks
started small, and I got a kick reading about their 2008 bicycle tour.</p>

<p>Apparently they built some trailers, tossed their instruments in, and proceeded to bicycle to gigs
all the way from Bellingham to San Diego (incidentally, two of my favorite towns).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s definitely one way to earn some West Coast cred. I&#8217;ve driven the
Pacific Coast Highway a couple times, and it is nearly a spiritual experience. I regret not joining
friends who have bicycled it.</p>

<p>As it is, the whole <em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6eLMGMZE8Kv9lCGCk551Bu">3 Rounds and a Sound</a></em> album from
2008 makes for some very chill listening. I took an immediate liking to the folksy lead-in
of <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/2LozqICm38mBX3yseiyOWa">&#8220;One Red Thread&#8221;</a>. For some reason it
really reminds me of <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/164gAwPYaCpFRfpDabXQON">&#8220;Yankee Bayonet&#8221;</a> from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decemberists">The Decemberists</a>.</p>

<h2>Wild Child (Austin, TX)</h2>

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:6PPFActErBg9LwXfMfOKYB&theme=white&view=coverart"
    width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"
    style="float:right;margin-left:30px;"></iframe>


<p><a href="http://wildchildsounds.com">Wild Child</a> describe themselves as a &#8220;folk-pop&#8221; band from Austin. Their
debut album, <em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6PPFActErBg9LwXfMfOKYB">Pillow Talk</a></em>, was released back in 2011.</p>

<p>Between Kelsey Wilson and Alex Beggins, <em>Pillow Talk</em> features the same back-and-forth vocals that
make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8">Edward Sharpe</a>
so compelling. And it makes you want to sing along in the same way that <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/0uZ0orE84drZZzPKxCWSmR">&#8220;Little Talks&#8221;</a>
does.</p>

<p>Whisky seems to be a frequent subject matter of <em>Pillow Talk</em>. I&#8217;d say that my personal favorite tracks
from this album are <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/5l7lNSHzTpVtd6Gee8XjUE">&#8220;Whiskey Dreams&#8221;</a> and
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/7rJeqhxvReMhpq5ylDO3Bf">&#8220;Cocaine Hurricane&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>I did some searching and thought that Wild Child had dropped off the face of the planet after their
first album, but the truth is much better. They&#8217;re recording their sophomore effort, <em>The Runaround</em>,
with funds they <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wildchild/wild-child-is-making-a-new-album-with-ben-kweller">raised on Kickstarter</a>.
So cool.</p>

<h2>Quiet Company, Boy &amp; Bear, Urban Cone &amp; more</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s what else made it into my <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/rohanrsingh/playlist/31nT82bgnsMpdSRS5PCILh"><em>Discovered: Winter 2013</em> playlist</a>:</p>

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:rohanrsingh:playlist:31nT82bgnsMpdSRS5PCILh&theme=white"
    width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"
    style="float:right;margin-left:30px;margin-bottom:10px;"></iframe>


<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Company">Quiet Company</a> is another indie band from Austin.
Very reminiscient of Death Cab, but with a more upbeat touch.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_%26_Bear">Boy &amp; Bear</a> are a folk rock quintet from Sydney. I
particularly love the sound of <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4HopuG8wQBlvXQ6xwA79FG">&#8220;Fall At Your Feet&#8221;</a>,
their tribute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Brothers">Tim &amp; Neil Finn</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/urbancone">Urban Cone</a> is an indie pop band that&#8217;s gotten a pretty big
following here among Stockholm natives. Take a look at their <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0TNzAX4rt4Efeth6eEfvxD">Urban Photograph</a>
release.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_(rapper">Classified</a> is an indie hip-hop artist from Nova Scotia who rhymes about the day-to-day with tracks like
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/3J2ZYJkhxGBOl3L8K4XGVu">&#8220;Pay Day&#8221;</a>. Really reminds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Scholars">Blue Scholars</a>
from Seattle.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.asafavidanmusic.com/">Asaf Avidan</a>, hailing from Jerusalem, is an artist I probably
should have heard about by now. In my defense, his earlier releases never made it to the USA. The
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/7KvEzNiTPrAPIbBILMLwQx">album of One Day (Reckoning Song) remixes</a> is
great music to work and crank out some code to.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Well, here&#8217;s to a year that I&#8217;m sure is going to be filled with excellent music.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just like every other Bob Dylan fan in the world, I have been endeavoring to
determine exactly how many roads a man must walk down. To this end, I&#8217;ve been
using passive location tracking for a few years now and have generated a fairly
significant amount of data on my movements and travel. Mostly I&#8217;ve used
<a href="http://latitude.google.com/">Google Latitude</a>, and enabled its optional history
feature.</p>

<p>Many people shudder at the privacy implications of this. Personally, I assume
my cell phone providers have very similar data on hand already, if not with
quite as much accuracy and precision.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve now started looking through the data to see how my movements have changed
over time. One really stark difference between living in Seattle and living in
Stockholm is my average furthest distance â€” on any given day how many miles away
from home do I make it?</p>

<p>Check it out. This a map of my movements in Seattle on Thursday, September 29, 2011:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/roads/seattle-20110929.png"></p>

<p>That was a fairly normal Thursday on which I went downtown for work, went back
home, and then went out for drinks on Capitol Hill. One cool thing about having
this data is that it helps spark your memory â€” I now remember that exact
evening, who I was with, and some of the conversations that we were having.
Location is an excellent trigger for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can see that the furthest I made it from home is <strong>4.3 miles</strong>. Most
of my days in Seattle seem to have a furthest distance figure of 4 to 6 miles.</p>

<p>Now, here&#8217;s a map of my movements in Stockholm on this Wednesday, September 26, 2012:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/roads/stockholm-20120926.png"></p>

<p>Again, a fairly normal Wednesday. I walked to the office, went to a show after
work, and then walked home. The difference, though, is that the furthest I made
it from home is only <strong>0.997 miles</strong>.</p>

<p>One mile instead of five miles. That&#8217;s a pretty significant difference. What
makes it especially interesting for me is that I lived pretty centrally in Seattle
and had a very enviable commute (15 minutes on the bus followed by 5 minutes
on a bike).</p>

<p>The same holds in Stockholm. I live fairly centrally and have a similarly short
commute. But the difference is that in Stockholm a short commute is a 15-minute walk,
rather than a 15-minute bus ride. This is the kind of thing you can enable when
you build for density, and it&#8217;s the kind of thing I hope to see become more
possible in Seattle as well.</p>

<p>Some caveats here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Neither of these days were climbing days for me, so I didn&#8217;t make it to the
climbing gym. If I look at climbing days, my distance from home in Seattle is
about 6 miles. In Stockholm it&#8217;s either 2 or 4 miles depending on which gym.
That&#8217;s definitely a less pronounced difference, but I think the theme still
holds.</p></li>
<li><p>Some neighborhoods in Seattle are fairly dense. On my stereotypical lazy Sundays
spent in and around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Seattle">Wallingford</a>,
I often didn&#8217;t make it even 2 miles from home. I could walk to restaurants,
the coffee shop, the beer shop and the pub without going even half a mile.
But unlike in Stockholm, that half a mile isn&#8217;t dense enough to have many
offices where a software engineer might be able to find employment. Rather,
I had to go downtown for work.</p></li>
<li><p>While I have a bunch of data points about myself and my movements, this whole
thing is â€” at its heart â€” quite anecdotal. I&#8217;m sure there are people
in Seattle who don&#8217;t usually have to go more than a mile from home. And I know
there are people in Stockholm who live further out and have to commute a few
miles.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, just some data that I thought was interesting.</p>

<time datetime="2012-05-02T08:40:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 2<span>nd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to building responsive Android apps, there are two commandments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t block the UI thread, ever.</li>
<li>Only access and modify the UI from the UI thread itself.</li>
</ol>


<p>The Android Dev Guide goes into <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#WorkerThreads">some detail about this</a>.
The usual solutions in Java are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spawn a thread that does work and then invoke <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#post%28java.lang.Runnable%29"><code>View.post</code></a>
with a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Runnable.html"><code>Runnable</code></a>
that manipulates the UI.</li>
<li>Implement and run an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html"><code>AsyncTask</code></a>
that does work in <code>doInBackground</code>, and then manipulates the UI in
<code>onPostExecute</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, both these solutions â€” though they are the bread and butter of
Android development â€” are pretty verbose and unwieldy:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2574564.js?file=ThreadWithRunnable.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>public void onClick(View v) {
    new Thread(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            final Bitmap bitmap = loadImageFromNetwork(&quot;http://example.com/image.png&quot;);
            mImageView.post(new Runnable() {
                public void run() {
                    mImageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
                }
            });
        }
    }).start();
}</code></pre></noscript></div>




<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2574564.js?file=UsingAsyncTask.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>public void onClick(View v) {
    new DownloadImageTask().execute(&quot;http://example.com/image.png&quot;);
}

private class DownloadImageTask extends AsyncTask&lt;String, Void, Bitmap&gt; {
    /** The system calls this to perform work in a worker thread and
      * delivers it the parameters given to AsyncTask.execute() */
    protected Bitmap doInBackground(String... urls) {
        return loadImageFromNetwork(urls[0]);
    }
    
    /** The system calls this to perform work in the UI thread and delivers
      * the result from doInBackground() */
    protected void onPostExecute(Bitmap result) {
        mImageView.setImageBitmap(result);
    }
}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I prefer <code>AsyncTask</code>, which has better semantics, but implementing one
<code>AsyncTask</code> after another quickly becomes tedious. Same with writing line after
line of <code>Runnable</code> boilerplate.</p>

<p>Enter Scala, using either the <a href="https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin">sbt Android plugin</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/rohansingh/android-scala-test">my Maven-based solution</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to create an implicit conversion from a function to a <code>Runnable</code>,
which can then be passed to <code>View.post</code> or <code>runOnUiThread</code>. Once we&#8217;ve done
that, it&#8217;s simple to use <code>spawn</code> from <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/concurrent/ops$.html"><code>scala.concurrent.ops</code></a>
to do background work.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a fully functional example:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2574564.js?file=MainActivity.scala'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>package com.rrsllc.android

import _root_.android.app.Activity
import _root_.android.os.Bundle
import org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet
import scala.concurrent.ops._

class MainActivity extends Activity with TypedActivity {
  def textview = findView(TR.textview)

  implicit def toRunnable[F](f: =&gt; F): Runnable =
    new Runnable() { def run() = f }

  override def onCreate(bundle: Bundle) {
    super.onCreate(bundle)
    setContentView(R.layout.main)

    textview.setText(&quot;hello, world!&quot;)

    spawn {
      val client = new DefaultHttpClient()
      val httpGet = new HttpGet(&quot;http://www.android.com&quot;)

      val result = try {
        val response = client.execute(httpGet)
        &quot;The response status was: &quot; + response.getStatusLine.toString
      }
      catch {
        case _ =&gt; &quot;Something went wrong.&quot;
      }

      runOnUiThread { textview.setText(result) }
    }
  }
}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This is so much nicer than the Java alternative. Instead of up to ten lines of boilerplate
for each background task, we end up with just the <code>spawn</code> and <code>runOnUiThread</code>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re waiting for that final push to switch over to Scala for your Android development,
I highly recommend the <a href="https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki">sbt</a> plugin for Android. Take
a look at its brilliant <a href="https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/wiki/getting-started">Getting Started guide</a>,
which will have you up and running in just a few minutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I had to make one of the toughest choices I&#8217;ve had in a while: a 30&#8221; Dell display,
or a 27&#8221; Apple Thunderbolt display. I went with the Thunderbolt display, partly because the colors
are better, but mostly for the convenience of having USB and ethernet integrated into the display.</p>

<p>The way this works, you can just plug your USB peripherals and your network cord into the
Thunderbolt display. Then, whenever you dock your MacBook Pro, you just connect the single
Thunderbolt cable and the display, USB devices, and network all work magically.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s much more convenient than doing the daily morning dance of plugging four or five things into
your MacBook, and it&#8217;s the closest thing we have to a good MacBook Pro dock.</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s the theory anyway. In reality, while the USB works fairly decently, the ethernet
connection dropped out on day one, and I haven&#8217;t been able to get it back since. Until today.</p>

<p>Here are the final steps that worked for me. Hopefully somebody else can save a bit of time with
this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>With the Thunderbolt display connected, visit the Network tab in System Preferences. If you see
<strong>Display Ethernet</strong> and/or <strong>Display FireWire</strong> in the list of network interfaces, select each
one and use the minus (<strong>-</strong>) button at the bottom of the list to remove it.</p>

<p>For me, <strong>Display FireWire</strong> was listed, but <strong>Display Ethernet</strong> was not. I&#8217;ve heard of others
having strange symptoms with neither or both listed.</p></li>
<li><p>Unplug the Thunderbolt display. This will not work if you keep the display plugged in while doing
the next few steps. Trust me, I tried it.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo rm /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist</code></p></li>
<li><p>Restart your MacBook Pro and log back in. Once you&#8217;ve logged in, connect your Thunderbolt display
again.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit the Network tab in System Preferences again. If you see <strong>Display Ethernet</strong> and <strong>Display
FireWire</strong> listed, you&#8217;re all good. Otherwise, click the plus (<strong>+</strong>) button at the bottom of
the list of network interfaces.</p>

<p>From the <strong>Interface</strong> dropdown, select the interface you have missing and click <strong>Create</strong>. If
you have both interfaces missing like I did, you will have to repeat this step for the other
interface.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>After all that, everything seems to be working smoothly for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement">ACTA</a>,
it&#8217;s a damaging piece of legislation very similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a>
â€” the difference being that ACTA is international in scope and much closer to
becoming reality than SOPA ever was. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0">Here is a video explaining ACTA</a>
which I found to be quite educational.</p>

<p>Anyway, Stockholm decided to take to the streets to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/332489143440319/">protest ACTA today</a>.
Here are a few photos of the fairly well-attended event that I managed to snap
on my phone:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week I moved from Seattle to Stockholm, where I&#8217;ll be working at
<a href="http://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>. I arrived and started settling in on Friday.
On Saturday, I decided to check out out the local bouldering scene.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s quite a few gyms in the area, and the closest ones to downtown are run
by <a href="http://klattercentret.se">KlÃ¤ttercentret</a> and <a href="http://klatterverket.se">KlÃ¤tterverket</a>.
The KlÃ¤ttercentret in Solna is the place I was really looking forward to
visiting. But since it&#8217;s closed for renovation until next week, I instead found
myself at the KlÃ¤ttercentret in Telefonplan.</p>

<p>What I found there was a style of setting I had never seen before on such a
scale â€” instead of being marked by tape, problems are based on holds that
are of the same color and style.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of the place by Helena Wahlman at <a href="http://blogs.sweden.se/photo/2010/11/19/climbing-at-klattercentret-telefonplan/">the Swedish photo blog</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.sweden.se/photo/2010/11/19/climbing-at-klattercentret-telefonplan/"><img src="/images/blog/klattercentret.jpg" title="Bouldering at KlÃ¤ttercentret" ></a></p>

<p>Look closely and you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s pretty much no tape on the wall. For
example, neither of the holds the guy in the photo is using are marked. Instead,
he knows to use them because they are yellow.</p>

<p>What little tape there is just marks the start and end of a problem. The color
of the tape is what specifies <a href="http://www.klattercentret.se/svenska/hallen/gradering">the problem&#8217;s approximate grade</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.klattercentret.se/svenska/hallen/gradering"><img src="/images/blog/klattercentret-grading.gif"></a></p>

<p>At the moment I&#8217;m not sure if this is a regional thing or just a KlÃ¤ttercentret
thing.</p>

<p>One thing I can tell you is that, at first, I was very, very confused! I&#8217;d
expected a different grading system, but when I first walked up to the wall in
Telefonplan, I seriously had no idea what was going on. Of course, I tried to
figure out what other people were doing, but I&#8217;m not used to looking at the
color of holds.</p>

<p>Until I realized what was up, I just figured everyone was improvising their
own problems. Also, at the time I hadn&#8217;t realized that the vast majority of the
bouldering area at Telefonplan was on a different floor. Those things combined to
make me wonder if I was in some special kind of hell where bouldering was just a
joke.</p>

<p>What finally made it click for me is when I found a long overhanging problem
comprised entirely of bright orange holds. Once I saw that, everything clicked
into place and I could suddenly see all the problems everywhere! There were
quite a few excellent problems, and overall it was a great session.</p>

<p>Thoughts on this style of setting:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Grading.</strong> The approximate grading is something I can appreciate. It lets
you walk up to a problem and have a general idea of what it&#8217;s going to be
like, but without forming preconceptions of whether or not you can handle it.
Moreover, it reflects the reality of a gym problem where grading is inexact
and approximate, based on the perception of a single setter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visibility.</strong> Once you get used to the idea, identifying holds based on hold
color isn&#8217;t that different from tape color. You do have the same problem as
with tape where similar adjacent colors can be difficult to pick apart. In
some cases, you have an additional problem where heavily-chalked holds become
difficult to identify.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Style</strong>. Each problem definitely takes on a certain style based on the type
of hold used. I imagine this could be really handy when you want to train a
specific skill. If you pick a problem that starts with a sloper, it&#8217;s going to
be full of slopers that came from the same set. Same with crimps, or jugs or
pockets or what-have-you. As an example, I&#8217;ve set something similar before
using a single set of bright pink crimps, and it was great for training crimps.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All that said, I&#8217;m still not sure about this system. In a way, I&#8217;m sure it
encourages creativity, as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-barry-kaufman/does-creativity-require-c_b_948460.html">limits and constraints tend to do</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, the fact remains â€” with a given set of holds, you can
express more problems and permutations if you can mix holds of different colors.
Then again, the point of setting is to create challenging, climbable problems,
not just to mathematically optimize your theoretical problem space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every now and then I have a discussion or lecture with my roommate Chris, on some aspect of software
engineer, architecture, process management, or programming in general. His specialization is
psychology, so while this exercise can be cathartic, it&#8217;s largely pointless. I&#8217;ve decided that it
might be more effective to write these things down and post them.</p>

<p>Today, prompted by a discussion on what I should name some new object, Chris asked:</p>

<blockquote><p>Isn&#8217;t all coding about being too clever?</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that is a conception that many laypeople and beginning programmers have â€” that we should try
to be clever. Seasoned engineers will know that being clever can be one of the worst sins.</p>

<p>Here was my response, paraphrased:</p>

<blockquote><p>The goal is to write the minimal code that (a) gets the job done, (b) doesn&#8217;t break, and (c) is
understandable and maintainable by other people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever&#8221; often meets the first requirement, can sometimes meet the second, and always fails
miserably at the third â€” which is actually the most important one. All things equal, I&#8217;d often
rather have a broken system that I can understand than a rat&#8217;s nest of code that happens to work.</p></blockquote>

<p>That said, sometimes you do come across clever code that meets all of those requirements. These are
small masterpieces and works of art and should be regarded as such.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3442497">someone on Hacker News</a>
posted a link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect">Wikipedia article on the inner-platform effect</a>,
which is &#8220;the tendency of software architects to create a system so customizable as to become a
replica, and often a poor replica, of the software development platform they are using.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of the article (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>In the database world, developers are sometimes tempted to bypass the RDBMS, for
example by storing everything in one big table with two columns labelled key and
value. While this entity-attribute-value model allows the developer to break out
from the structure imposed by an SQL database, it loses out on all the benefits,
since all of the work that could be done efficiently by the RDBMS is forced onto
the application instead. Queries become much more convoluted, the indexes and
query optimizer can no longer work effectively, and data validity constraints
are not enforced. <strong>Such designs rarely make their way into real world production
systems, however, because performance tends to be little better than abysmal,
due to all the extra joins required.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh man, if only. I can think of at least <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">one example</a> of a
a platform with this very problem â€” and with the associated horrible performance profile â€” that is
very widely deployed and used in production environments around the world. I&#8217;m sure you can think of
others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I begin, here are a few great, relevant xkcd&#8217;s:
<a href="http://xkcd.com/719/">#719</a>
<a href="http://xkcd.com/430/">#430</a>
<a href="http://xkcd.com/203/">#203</a></p>

<p>Anyhow, say what you will about Scott Rosenberg&#8217;s book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400082463?tag=rohanradiocom-20">Dreaming in Code</a></em>
â€” but the fact is, it makes Googling for experiences of <em>actually dreaming in code</em>
<a href="http://google.com/search?q=dreaming+in+code">fairly impossible</a>.</p>

<p>Personally though, I find dreaming in code to be very real.
My dreams have always quite vividly blended reality and the imaginary, often
leaving me confused as to which is which, and leaving me with a somewhat tenuous
connection to the former. Code dreams are no different, and I&#8217;ve found that mine
fit into three major types:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Text Editor</strong>. This is your fairly standard code dream. In my case,
white background, plain text and some code appearing or being written.
Sometimes, it might make sense and actually relate to a project I&#8217;ve been
working on or code I&#8217;ve being writing, but quite often this code doesn&#8217;t make
any sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>Often, there is no background or text, but just the lines and constructs of
code floating in a place where there is no physical reality. I wonder if
mathematicians have dreams similar to these, but with mathematical constructs?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Inspiration</strong>. These dreams are comparatively rare, and don&#8217;t actually
seem to involve any coding whatsoever. However, they very specifically relate
to something I am working on, and when I wake up I know how to structure some
code that I have been struggling with.</p>

<p>This seems to be a pretty straightforward case of the brain working on a
waking-world concern while asleep. Too bad the hours aren&#8217;t billable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Blends With Reality</strong>. This is the strangest type of dream and the
most difficult to relate, but in many ways my favorite. In these dreams,
physical reality seems to blend and mix with the reality of code. While there
is a normal dream of the physical world underlying everything here, in these
dreams I interact with that world with code instead of in the normal physical
manner.</p>

<p>For example, I might find myself writing a script to light a campfire.
Or instead of traveling from place to place by walking or in a car, I might
just fiddle with the parameters that define my location. People may speak in code
or in concepts rather than words.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Overall, I find #3 to be the most common type of code dream I have, as well as
the most interesting. It lets the world become a playground that is strangely
close to the real world. It is almost as if, in these dreams, magic is real, and
code is magic.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s probably not the most important thing in the world, I&#8217;m really
curious to hear whether lots of other people out there dream in code, and how
everyone else&#8217;s code dreams differ from mine.</p>

<p>After all, we spend an amazing amount of time asleep throughout the course of
our lives. Who knows, maybe if talk about dreaming code enough, clients will
agree that those hours asleep should be billable after all, eh?</p>
