  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been a big fan of JSON via HTTP POST to send data to a Web service.
It&#8217;s awesome for a bunch of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Works equally well for simple and complex data.</strong> Regular HTTP POST works great
for simple data, but gets unwieldy for anything hierarchical. XML works for
complex data, but is too wordy for something simple.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compact and human-readable.</strong> Really, this just comes with the territory when
you&#8217;re using JSON for anything.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to debug using Fiddler or related tools.</strong> You just have to type in or
modify a JSON string when you want to do some ad-hoc testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to add support for to any server.</strong> In fact, support for receiving JSON
POST is built into the latest versions of
<a href="http://docs.cherrypy.org/dev/refman/lib/jsontools.html">CherryPy</a> and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.jsonvalueproviderfactory.aspx">ASP.NET MVC</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That said, JSON POST still doesn&#8217;t seem to be all that popular compared to
an old-style URL-encoded HTTP POST. One explanation I&#8217;ve heard proposed for
this is the lack of support in jQuery. By default, jQuery goes with the
old-style POST. You know:</p>

<pre><code>foo=bar&amp;abc=xyz&amp;x=123
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, you can pass in a complex type and jQuery will gladly serialize it
into this format for you, but good luck trying to read that with your human
eyes, or trying to piece it back together on the server in any sane way.</p>

<p>The really sad thing is that jQuery has a great <code>getJSON()</code> function that lets
you receive JSON output and parses it appropriately. But there is no
built-in support for posting raw JSON.</p>

<p>To that end, I threw together this little plugin that I use all over the
place:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a little trick I use. I figured I&#8217;d share it just in case anyone else
finds it useful.</p>

<p>Whenever I need to decide whether something is good, whether I support it or I
don&#8217;t, it all comes together in one simple question. In the ideal world that I
want to live in — the ideal, peaceful, happy, loving, accepting world — would
this thing be or would it not be?</p>

<p>Once you start putting things into that perspective, everything becomes quite
straightforward. Whatever the issue or thing is, all you have to do is ask that
one simple question, and then the correct path of action often becomes quite
clear.</p>

<p>Whether the issue you are considering is one of those big values-based divides
of our day — war, abortion, gay marriage, religion — or whether it is just a
simple matter of your daily dealings with other people, all you have to do is
ask yourself: is this the world I want to live in?</p>

<time datetime="2010-09-13T16:58:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 13<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>What follows has probably been expounded a thousand times in different places.
In fact, MSDN even has a long article entitled
<a href="http://rrs.co/aMavUs">Best Practices for Handling Exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>That said, I believe the best practices when it comes to catching .NET
exceptions can be boiled down into four basic rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do not catch an exception unless you have something specific you need to do with
that exception in the place you are catching it. Generally, there’s two
scenarios where it’s alright to catch an exception:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you can do something specific to respond to and recover from a specific
exception.</li>
<li>When you have specific logging or, in the UI, want to display a specific error
message due to a specific exception.</li>
</ol>


<p>Every exception and every catch block incurs a major performance overhead. If
you can’t do something that fits into one of these two categories, you generally
should not catch the exception. Note that this means that catching <code>Exception</code>
instead of a specific type of exception is almost never correct.</p></li>
<li><p>When you want to convert an exception to a string for logging, just use
<code>ex.ToString()</code>. Do not try to <code>ToString()</code> or do any complex operations on any of
the exception&#8217;s other properties in a way that could fail if those properties are
null. For example, <code>ex.SomeProperty.ToString()</code> is almost never correct since
<code>SomeProperty</code> might be null. Even if it seems to not be null when you are
testing, since this is by definition an exceptional case you can’t be sure what
properties of the exception may or may not be filled.</p>

<p>More generally, avoid doing things in a catch block that may cause another
exception to be thrown. Don’t nest try-catch blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Never do anything that would hide an exception from bubbling up unless you have
specific code that can recover from the exception. For example, even if you are
logging an exception in your catch block, rethrow it so any logging code higher
up will be able to process it as well.</p>

<p>The only time you should not rethrow an
exception is when you can recover from it and the code can keep running fine.</p>

<p>That said, if you can recover from an exception and the code can keep running,
see if it would be possible to predict the exception beforehand and avoid it. As
an example, say you are going to try to call <code>ToUpper()</code> on a string. If the
string is null beforehand, you already know that a null reference exception will
be thrown, so don’t call <code>ToUpper()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you rethrow an exception, always just use <code>throw;</code>. Do not use <code>throw ex;</code>.
The latter restarts the call stack and makes debugging much more difficult. The only
time you would do the latter is if you want to hide internals for some reason
like security, which is almost never needed.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>HTML5 has a <a href="http://html5demos.com/database">Database API</a> that lets you
store things locally and retrieve them with SQL queries.</li>
<li>Android lets you embed a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html">WebView</a>
in your application to display web content.</li>
<li>How to combine #1 and #2 is extremely poorly documented.</li>
</ol>


<p>One thing that kills me about the Android documentation is how it&#8217;s so
hit-or-miss. Some things are so well documented that I have literally been able
to copy code out of the docs into my code and just change it a little. Actually,
my roommate saw me do this at one point and accused me of plagiarism. But that
is the subject of another post entitled &#8220;Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Take Coding Advice
From Psychology Majors&#8221;.</p>

<p>But really, I think the #1 best thing you can do when releasing a platform or
public API of any sort is include tons of samples, inline with the
documentation. The real winners when it comes to doing this are the
<a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php">PHP documentation</a> and the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312.aspx">MSDN .NET Framework documentation</a>.
Almost every single class and function in the docs for these platforms includes
a sample of how to use the thing.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s not a coincidence that PHP and .NET are so popular?</p>

<p>It took me way too long to find out how to enable HTML5 Database API support for
content displayed inside a WebView on an Android. The pieces were scattered all
over the Intertubes, though I finally found the last piece of the puzzle on
<a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/2009/11/05/how-to-implement-html5-storage-on-a-webview-with-android-2-0/">Joe Bowser&#8217;s blog</a>.

<p>Note that the <code>onExceededDatabaseQuota</code> is mandatory. I am pretty sure the default
quota is zero, so you need to override this method and provide a quota to allow
storage. I&#8217;m using <code>estimatedSize * 2</code> as the new quota since my app is browsing
to a known page that only stores a small amount of data. Your scenario may be
different.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been listening to this one song on repeat for pretty much the entire
day:</p>

<div>
    <embed src="http://listen.grooveshark.com/songWidget.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
        wmode="window" width="500" height="40" flashvars="hostname=cowbell.grooveshark.com&amp;widgetID=22158641&amp;style=metal&amp;p=0">
    </embed>
</div>


<p>Let me explain a bit further. I barely know anyone today who doesn&#8217;t listen to
music while working. But I&#8217;ve been reading the classic
<em><a href="http://rrs.co/dxohFz">Peopleware</a></em> book, and
apparently back in the &#8217;60s this was something that researchers at Cornell
thought was worth looking into. They took a group of computer science students
and split them into two groups.</p>

<p>The first group went into a silent room, and the second group went into a room
where they could listen to music using headphones. There was an equal
distribution of students who said they liked to listen to music while working
and those who didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Everyone was then given the same coding problem. The challenge was to implement
a program from a pretty complicated spec, using Fortran (hey, it was the &#8217;60s
after all). Not surprisingly, there wasn&#8217;t much difference between what went on
in the two rooms. Both groups of students were able to do the challenge at about
the same speed and with the same skill. No big surprise, right?</p>

<p>Except for this, from Peopleware (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>The Cornell experiment, however, contained a hidden wild card. The specification
required that an output data stream be formed through a series of manipulations
on numbers in the input data stream &#8230; Although the specification never said
it, the <strong>net effect of all the operations was that each output number was
necessarily equal to its input number</strong>. Some people realized this and others did
not. Of those who figured it out, the overwhelming majority came from the quiet
room.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about that for a second. Here are these two groups of students who are
given what they think is a fairly mechanical task: look at this spec that tells
you how these numbers should be manipulated, write some code that does the
manipulations. And all of them were able to complete the mechanical,
mathematical portion of this task at about the same speed.</p>

<p>But inside the mechanical task was something that required a creative leap:
figuring out that the output numbers of the program would be exactly the same as
its input. Something like that might be obvious today with our fancy interactive
debuggers, but you have to imagine it must have taken quite the leap to figure
it out while stamping Fortran code into punch cards. This is the kind of leap
that could save hours upon hours of work and tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>To make this creative leap, you almost invariably had to be in the quiet room.</p>

<p>To the crack neurologist in me, it makes sense. Music is a creative activity,
and listening to it probably engages the creative part of your brain. Everything
seems fine when you are working, since most of what you are doing is
mathematical, analytical, or mechanical. What you don&#8217;t realize is that your
creative areas are too engaged with the music to be engaged with the problem at
hand.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;s alright sometimes when you&#8217;re just powering through something
you&#8217;ve done a million times, but how sustainable is that approach? Unless our
basic neurology has changed since the 1960&#8217;s, it seems clear that to make the
creative leaps in software design &#8211; and probably anything else &#8211; you have to
turn the music off at some point.</p>

<p>The thing that kills me about this is that I like music. It&#8217;s awesome. I love
listening to music, and I do it almost exclusively when I work and no time else.
I think I&#8217;ve developed the habit of sometimes listening to just one song on
repeat as a type of defense strategy. The music gives you a rhythm and a beat to
work to, but when it&#8217;s just the same song a million times over, you can start to
tune it out. Maybe that lets the creative part of your brain re-engage with your
work?</p>

<p>Then again, maybe I have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
