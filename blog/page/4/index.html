  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jon Stewart just went down a couple points in my book when I saw this clip:</p>

<div>
        <embed src="http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:cms:item:comedycentral.com:340734"
            width="540" height="439" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
            allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" base="." flashVars="">
        </embed>
</div>


<p>What he says in that clip is that, at their core, science and religion are very
similar because he thinks they both require you to take things on faith. Jon
says religion asks you to believe in a supernatural being that you can&#8217;t see,
and that you should just believe he is there. Similarly, Jon thinks science asks
you to believe that the universe is composed largely of a type of matter that
you can&#8217;t see, and you should just believe it&#8217;s there.</p>

<p>The difference, of course, is that dark matter can actually be measured even
though you can&#8217;t see it. For example, you might not be able to see the bottom of
a deep well, but you can measure it by dropping a rock down there. In the same
way, dark matter can be measured through its gravitational influence on other
matter.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always thought of Jon as a very smart guy and continue to think that, but
this was kind of painful to watch. Looks like
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/09/marilynne-robinson-on-jon_n_640577.html#comments">some other people agree as well</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s my idea for the day: a variable gas tax based on local density and
transit availability. This could help the state raise revenue and encourage
people to park their cars where possible. But at the same time, it would make
sure those who absolutely need to drive aren&#8217;t put in an impossible position.</p>

<p>For an example, consider Seattle. Most of the city has medium-to-high density
and transit is widely available. Residents can get to work and school using the
bus, light rail, or bicycles. Walkable neighborhoods mean that you can stroll
to your destination as well. If we can reduce the number of cars on the street
while encouraging healthier, more sustainable lifestyles and helping the city
build better neighborhoods, it makes sense for gas to cost as much as $5
per gallon.</p>

<p>A counterexample would be a town like Ellensburg, WA. Though it is
technically a college town, density is low and mass transit is virtually
nonexistent. This is a place you really couldn&#8217;t survive without a car.
This is a place where you wouldn&#8217;t raise gas taxes, but also a place that
would benefit from the increased gas tax revenues elsewhere.</p>

<p>An additional feature would be to only apply this variable gas tax to
individual consumers at that point of sale. It would not apply to small
businesses or freight, so the price of food or other goods would not be
affected.</p>

<p>Just an idea I thought up on the ride home so there could be some major
hole I&#8217;m missing. But I think it&#8217;s important to consider alternative tax
structures that could help everyone.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About three years ago, I was living in a condo in the Sand Point area
of Seattle. We were planning on throwing a little party, but somebody
pointed out that I didn&#8217;t really have any furniture. Before that party,
Alex Miller and I went onto craigslist and found a few couches. We rented
ourselves a U-Haul and went around town picking them up and dropping
them off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/couch.jpg"></p>

<p>That was three years ago. Since then these couches, and particularly
the one above, have served as resting places for many a weary traveler.
Times have changed. Since Chris and I just got a really nice new place,
I am going to have let these couches go.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d just let everyone know, in case you want to take a moment
to reflect or leave a memory for the couch. It will be greatly missed,
though I&#8217;m sure it will go on to many bigger and better things.</p>

<p>PS: Free couch in front of 4736 20th Ave NE if you want it.</p>
