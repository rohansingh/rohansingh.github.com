    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week I moved from Seattle to Stockholm, where I'll be working at
<a href="http://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>. I arrived and started settling in on Friday.
On Saturday, I decided to check out out the local bouldering scene.</p>

<p>There's quite a few gyms in the area, and the closest ones to downtown are run
by <a href="http://klattercentret.se">Klättercentret</a> and <a href="http://klatterverket.se">Klätterverket</a>.
The Klättercentret in Solna is the place I was really looking forward to
visiting. But since it's closed for renovation until next week, I instead found
myself at the Klättercentret in Telefonplan.</p>

<p>What I found there was a style of setting I had never seen before on such a
scale — instead of being marked by tape, problems are based on holds that
are of the same color and style.</p>

<p>Here's a photo of the place by Helena Wahlman at <a href="http://blogs.sweden.se/photo/2010/11/19/climbing-at-klattercentret-telefonplan/">the Swedish photo blog</a>:</p>

<p>Look closely and you'll see that there's pretty much no tape on the wall. For
example, neither of the holds the guy in the photo is using are marked. Instead,
he knows to use them because they are yellow.</p>

<p>What little tape there is just marks the start and end of a problem. The color
of the tape is what specifies <a href="http://www.klattercentret.se/svenska/hallen/gradering">the problem's approximate grade</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.klattercentret.se/svenska/hallen/gradering"><img src="/images/blog/klattercentret-grading.gif"></a></p>

<p>At the moment I'm not sure if this is a regional thing or just a Klättercentret
thing.</p>

<p>One thing I can tell you is that, at first, I was very, very confused! I'd
expected a different grading system, but when I first walked up to the wall in
Telefonplan, I seriously had no idea what was going on. Of course, I tried to
figure out what other people were doing, but I'm not used to looking at the
color of holds.</p>

<p>Until I realized what was up, I just figured everyone was improvising their
own problems. Also, at the time I hadn't realized that the vast majority of the
bouldering area at Telefonplan was on a different floor. Those things combined to
make me wonder if I was in some special kind of hell where bouldering was just a
joke.</p>

<p>What finally made it click for me is when I found a long overhanging problem
comprised entirely of bright orange holds. Once I saw that, everything clicked
into place and I could suddenly see all the problems everywhere! There were
quite a few excellent problems, and overall it was a great session.</p>

<p>Thoughts on this style of setting:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Grading.</strong> The approximate grading is something I can appreciate. It lets
you walk up to a problem and have a general idea of what it's going to be
like, but without forming preconceptions of whether or not you can handle it.
Moreover, it reflects the reality of a gym problem where grading is inexact
and approximate, based on the perception of a single setter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visibility.</strong> Once you get used to the idea, identifying holds based on hold
color isn't that different from tape color. You do have the same problem as
with tape where similar adjacent colors can be difficult to pick apart. In
some cases, you have an additional problem where heavily-chalked holds become
difficult to identify.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Style</strong>. Each problem definitely takes on a certain style based on the type
of hold used. I imagine this could be really handy when you want to train a
specific skill. If you pick a problem that starts with a sloper, it's going to
be full of slopers that came from the same set. Same with crimps, or jugs or
pockets or what-have-you. As an example, I've set something similar before
using a single set of bright pink crimps, and it was great for training crimps.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All that said, I'm still not sure about this system. In a way, I'm sure it
encourages creativity, as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-barry-kaufman/does-creativity-require-c_b_948460.html">limits and constraints tend to do</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, the fact remains — with a given set of holds, you can
express more problems and permutations if you can mix holds of different colors.
Then again, the point of setting is to create challenging, climbable problems,
not just to mathematically optimize your theoretical problem space.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2011/12/06/thoughts-on-home-walls-setting/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-06T23:40:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rohanradio.com/blog/2011/12/06/thoughts-on-home-walls-setting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think of all the things I love about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Seattle">where I live</a>,
having a climbing wall in our studio is definitely in my top three. We had a couple
of constraints in constructing the wall:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our lease doesn't allow pounding anything into the wall, so the structure had
to be entirely free-standing.</li>
<li>I love bouldering on overhanging walls — the steeper the better. But we wanted
to be sensitive to the fact that overhangs are not everyone's cup of tea.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Wall</h2>

<p>In the end, we settled on an adjustable 10' x 10' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean-to">lean-to</a>
design.</p>

<p>My roommate Chris and I have both found that mentioning the dimensions of the wall is a great
heuristic for identifying climbers and non-climbers. The usual response from a
non-climber is along the lines of, "Really? Isn't that too small?"</p>

<p>Everyone always changes their mind on that after a good workout on the wall.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/climbing-wall/before.jpg"></p>

<p>Chris and a friend handled most of the construction of the structure, which took
about 40 hours in total. I think the most time-consuming part of the process —
aside from waiting for the deck paint to dry – was drilling each of the dozens upon
dozens of holes and installing a t-nut in each.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the incline is adjustable. Originally we had a 15°
overhang, but have since dropped the wall down a bit further to 30°. This seems
to be a nice compromise given that our friends are climbers with varying amounts
of experience, specialties, and skill levels.</p>

<h2>Setting — First Try</h2>

<p>Initially, I tried a couple of traditional setting strategies. The specifics
varied, but the basic idea was to visualize the outline of a problem and then
set it piece by piece. I quickly learned a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>This takes skill.</strong> Just because you are good at climbing a certain type of
problem does not mean you will be able to set similar satisfying problems.
It's a completely different thought process and creative skillset.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Setting is hard work!</strong> At first I was trying out the problem as I set each
piece, which was very tiring. I heard a better strategy was to set the whole
problem before trying to test and tweak it. This was great advice, but
climbing up and down with holds and screwing them in is still a lot of work.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I came out with a newfound respect for routesetters at the gyms I
go to, and it gave me some small amount of additional insight into bouldering
problems in general.</p>

<h2>Setting — Second Try</h2>

<p>What ultimately made me try a different strategy was thinking more deeply about
how we were using the wall. Given that the friends I climb with are all at
different levels, we would generally just try climbing around or playing add-on
rather than climbing specific problems.</p>

<p><em>Add-on</em> is a very simple game. In a sense, it's the bouldering version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#H-O-R-S-E">H.O.R.S.E</a>.
The first climber chooses a starting position and makes a single move. The next
climber copies that move, and then <em>adds on</em> another move. This is a great game
when you have climbers at different levels, since everyone can play along and
take part in some friendly competition.</p>

<p>Given that we were using the wall this way, I started thinking more about where
to place holds on an individual basis, rather than where to place problems.
Instead of trying to visualize an entire problem, I now just think about where a
single hold might be interesting, and what orientation might make it fun to pull
on.</p>

<p>Since I only have to consider one hold at a time, the cognitive load required is
a lot lower. This is nice, since I'm not a very good routesetter. By just
throwing up each hold in an interesting position, it's a lot easier for me to
fill the whole wall.</p>

<p>Here's one of my favorite holds from <a href="http://www.soillholds.com/">So Ill</a>,
brilliantly entitled <em><a href="http://www.soillholds.com/the-picking-jug">The Picking</a></em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/climbing-wall/nose.jpg"></p>

<p>As a field test, we played quite a few games of add-on last Saturday, and it was
tons of fun!</p>

<h2>New Holds &amp; Resetting</h2>

<p>I've subscribed to So Ill's <a href="http://www.soillholds.com/sick-kit-club-monthly">hold of the month club</a>,
and it gives me an excuse to reset things and try something new every month or so.
These just arrived recently:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/climbing-wall/new-holds.jpg"></p>

<p>I took the opportunity to move things around a fair bit. I moved <em>The Picking</em>
much higher up, and rotated it to a fun new orientation. I also threw on a
smattering of underclings and other new stuff.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/climbing-wall/after.jpg"></p>

<p>I had actually tried putting <em>The Picking</em> in a similar orientation originally,
but found that the it would just spin when pulled sideways — no matter
how tightly I tried to bolt it in. This time I wised up and put a small hold
below it to give it some reinforcement.</p>

<p>New game of add-on tomorrow, and we'll see how it goes!</p>
